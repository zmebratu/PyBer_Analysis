# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project
This analysis was done to identify any disparities between city type and weekly fares.

## Results
With the results obtained, there are many differences between each city type. The urban city has more than double the amount of riders and drivers than the suburban and rural city. As a result of this, the amount of money being spent on fares in the urban city is double the amount in suburban and nine times the amount of rural. On the otherhand, within the rural city, the average fare per driver is $55.49. This is more than three times the amount of urban city drivers. In addition to this, the average fare per ride is $10 more than the urban city. The rural city also has the least amount of drivers when compared to urban- 2405 and suburban- 490.
