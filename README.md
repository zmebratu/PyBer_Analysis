# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project
This analysis was done to identify any disparities between city type and weekly fares.

## Results
With the results obtained, there are many differences between each city type. The urban cities have more than double the number of riders and drivers than the suburban and rural cities. As a result of this, the amount of money being spent on fares in the urban cities($39,854.38) is double the amount of suburban($19,356.33) and nine times the amount of rural($4,327.93). There is also a disparity with the amount of driverâ€™s vs the total rides given. There are more drivers(2405) than ride sharers(1625). On the other hand, within the rural cities, the average fare per driver is $55.49. This is more than three times the amount of urban city drivers. In addition to this, the average fare per ride is $10 more than the urban cities. The rural cities also have the least number of drivers when compared to urban(2405) and suburban(490). 
In the chart we can confirm suburban and urban had the highest fare peak between the months of February and March. While the rural cities had the highest peak in April. We can still verify that in 2019, urban cities had the highest fare while rural had the least.

## Summary
Due to the disparities among city type, I would recommend an increase in the number of drivers within the rural areas in hopes of increasing revenue and access to the residents. I also recommend a slight decrease in fare price. As well as an increase in suburban drivers or a distribution of urban drivers to suburban and rural cities.
